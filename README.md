👋 Hi, I’m @modelzilla — exploring the frontier where data meets intelligence.

🧠 I'm learning the foundations of supervised and unsupervised learning, and getting hands-on with model building, evaluation, and interpretation.

🐍 I use Python (with libraries like scikit-learn and pandas) to explore datasets, train models, and better understand how machines can learn from data.

🌱 Currently focused on improving my skills through personal projects, courses, and small experiments in predictive modeling.

🤝 Always excited to connect, learn from others, and collaborate on beginner-friendly ML projects.

📫 Find me on YouTube and Instagram, where I share what I'm learning along the way.

⚡ Fun fact: I love sci-fi and always wonder what an AI would think of The Matrix.

🔁 I’m teaching machines to learn — and in the process, they’re helping me grow too. 🤖📚
