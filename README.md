👋 Hi, I’m @datawhispererme!
👀 I’m passionate about data science, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. My interests also extend to data mining, and I enjoy using R and Python for data analysis and visualization.
🌱 Currently, I’m diving into the Foundations of Probability using Python and R, focusing on statistical theory and simulation techniques.
💞️ I’m eager to collaborate on open-source projects related to statistical modeling, simulation, and data analysis.
📫 You can reach me through my YouTube channel (https://www.youtube.com/@datawhispererme) and Instagram profile (https://www.instagram.com/datawhispererme/).
⚡ Fun fact: I'm a big fan of LoTR and sci-fi movies!

I whisper to data, and sometimes, they whisper back. 📊✨
